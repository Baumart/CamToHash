## Overview

Provide a brief overview of the project. For example:
- This project captures images from a USB camera and generates a SHA-256 hash from the image data.
- The hash can be used for cryptographic purposes or as a random value generator.
- Designed for educational purposes or as a base for further development.

---

## Features

- Captures images from a USB camera or uses a stored image.
- Converts the image into a byte array for processing.
- Generates a SHA-256 hash from the image data.
- Allows consistent and random hash generation from image data.

---

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries:
  - OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
  - NumPy
  - hashlib (built-in)

Install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   [git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/Baumart/CamToEnrcyption.git)
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CamToEnrcyption
   ```

---

## Usage

### Capture an Image and Generate a Hash
1. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python capture_and_hash.py
   ```
2. The script will:
   - Capture an image from the USB camera.
   - Generate a SHA3-512 hash from the image data.
   - Display the hash in the console.


### Example Output
```plaintext
Generated random hash: 4d2c5ff1e8e33f6352db3b7a9df9f8b49b9f365fa4c9b26a73772b8e529ec6b7
```
